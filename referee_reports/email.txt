Dear Mr. Shaw:

Thank you again for submitting your manuscript DGJCI.2025.0042 entitled "Adaptive Supergeo Design: A Scalable Framework for Geographic Marketing Experiments" to Journal of Causal Inference (JCI).

In view of the criticisms of the reviewer(s) found at the bottom of this letter, I regret that I cannot accept your manuscript for publication in JCI. This decision must be regarded as final.

Manuscripts submitted to JCI can sometimes fall short for acceptance for publication for a number of reasons. For example, the submitted article may be too specialized and therefore not suitable for the broad readership we enjoy with JCI. The results from the study may not be novel and innovative, and only a relatively small advance in information can be gained from the submitted work.

Although we appreciate your scientific efforts represented by this work, I regret to inform you that we do not consider this work to be of sufficient interest to our readership to warrant publication.

Thank you for considering JCI for publication of your research. I hope the outcome of this specific submission will not discourage you from submission of future manuscripts.

Kind regards
Editorial office
Journal of Causal Inference
