% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to LaTeX to determine where to break the
% lines. Using \AND forces a line break at that point. So, if LaTeX puts 3 of 4
% authors names on the first line, and the last on the second line, try using
% \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

\begin{abstract}
\noindent We propose a generalization of the standard matched pairs design %\Shunhua{Change the name to paired matching design?}\Aiyou{+1 as no other paper mention 'mimum-weight matching experimental design'} 
in which experimental units (often geographic regions or \emph{geos}) may be combined into larger units/regions called ``supergeos'' in order to improve the average matching quality. % without excluding geos which would lead to poorly matched pairs. 
Unlike optimal matched pairs design which can be found in polynomial time \citep{lu2011optimal}, this generalized matching problem is NP-hard. We formulate it as a mixed-integer program (MIP) and show that experimental design obtained by solving this MIP can often provide a significant improvement over the standard design regardless of whether the treatment effects are homogeneous or heterogeneous. Furthermore, we present the conditions under which trimming techniques that often improve performance in the case of homogeneous effects \citep{chen2022robust}, may lead to biased estimates and show that the proposed design does not introduce such bias. We use empirical studies based on real-world advertising data to illustrate these findings.
%When the treatment effects are homogeneous, the performance of the proposed method is comparable (usually better) \Shunhua{Usually better is to be too strong. I would remove it.} than that of the \emph{Trimmed Match Design} (TMD) \Shunhua{Trimmed match estimator?} from \citet{chen2021trimmed} which excludes (i.e.~\emph{trims}) some of the poorly matched pairs in order to reduce the variance of the estimate. When the effects are heterogeneous, the proposed method may substantially outperform TMD for estimating the average treatment effect across the entire population.\Aiyou{A comparison with classical matched pairs design would have more impact than with TMD, as revised above; Please feel free to revert.}
% We also introduce a number of heuristics that allow solving the problem with hundreds of units without much detriment to the statistical performance. 
%\Shunhua{The abstract seems a bit long to me. Can we make it more concise?}\Aiyou{Shortened a little.}\Shunhua{LGTM}
% Numerical studies based on real data are reported.
